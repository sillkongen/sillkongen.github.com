Summary Learn how to reset or restart iPod following a freeze.

If you have an iPod shuffle, click here for reset steps. If you have an iPod touch, see this document.

Important: If your iPod is frozen or won't turn on, it may be because iPod is paused or the Hold switch is in the locked position. 

If so, a lock symbol appears on the screen. Slide the Hold switch to the unlocked position and check the screen.

If the iPod displays shows any of the following messages you should eject the iPod from within iTunes instead of resetting it:"Connected. Eject before disconnecting Sync in Progress. Please wait... Do not disconnect"

If your iPod is frozen or won't turn on, the steps to reset it vary by model. You can easily tell which iPod model you have if you're not sure.

1. Toggle the Hold switch ona ndoff. (Slideit to Hold,then turn it off again.)

2. Press and hold the Menu and Center (Select) buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 8 seconds. You may need to repeat this step.
